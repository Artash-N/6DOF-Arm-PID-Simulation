# Joint-Space Trajectory Planning & Control for a Robotic Arm (PyBullet)

### End-to-end Demonstration Project of PD control, feedforward, trajectory planning, and reinforcement learning. 
_Created for use by Stanford Robotics Club onboarding._

This module introduces real-world robotic arm motion control through simulation. This includes planning smooth joint trajectories, tracking them using feedback control, compensating for physical concepts like intertia and gravity, and diagnosing results and performance using logs
